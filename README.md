# Pac-Roller
A "reimagining" of Pac-man, where the stage moves instead of the player. Uploading for preservation purposes.

A and D rotate the stage, W and S change the rotation speed. Whenever all points are collected, they're respawned. When the player loses all 3 lives, the game is "reset" (score zeroed, 3 lives again).
